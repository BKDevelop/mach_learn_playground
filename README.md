# My machine learning Playground

Dear visitor,

this is my little data science / machine learning playground. I will try out and implement different projects in Python using several libraries, e. g. ‘scikit-learn’, ‘numpy’, ‘scipy’ …

## Project list

### NFL Play by play prediction
I used a [play-by-play data set of the 2012 NFL season](http://archive.advancedfootballanalytics.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html) for all teams and tried out several machine learning models to predict the pay call (‘Run’ or ‘Pass’) on the first three downs based on down and distance.

The models predict the playcall correctly 57% to 60% of the time. While not great, this is a better result then picking a random playcall. Because of the great strategic complexity of the game, I believe that feeding more data into the models (Time? Point differential?) could lead to better results. 


## Suggestions, other Feedback

I am always eager to learn and improve so any advice or feedback is highly appreciated :)

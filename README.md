# My machine learning Playground

Dear visitor,

this is my little data science / machine learning playground. I will try out and implement different projects in Python using several libraries, e. g. ‘scikit-learn’, ‘numpy’, ‘scipy’ …

## Project list

### Simple Neural Network
I built a simple neural network utilising backpropagation just using numpy.

### NFL Play by play prediction
I used a [play-by-play data set of the 2012 NFL season](http://archive.advancedfootballanalytics.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html) for all teams and tried out several machine learning models to predict the pay call (‘Run’ or ‘Pass’) on the first three downs based on down and distance. Later I also included 4th down calls ('Field Goal', 'Punt').

The models predict the playcall correctly 60% to 67% of the time. This is a surprisingly good result, given the strategic complexity of the game.

## Suggestions, other Feedback

I am always eager to learn and improve so any advice or feedback is highly appreciated :)
